<!-- Pass the rainbow object to the walkTheDog function. -->
<!-- The walkTheDog function depends on the object having a walkTimes array property. But rainbow doesn't have one. -->
<!-- What happens when you try to call walkTheDog, with rainbow as the argument? Describe the error you get. Why do you get the error you do? -->
<!-- 	* got the following console error: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined -->
<!-- 	* this occured because object 'rainbow' has missing / undefined array property 'walktimes'. -->
<!-- How would you fix the code so it works?? -->
<!-- 	* to fix this error, add array property 'walktimes' to object 'rainbow'. -->
<!-- Turn in the file fixed so you don't see this error. -->
